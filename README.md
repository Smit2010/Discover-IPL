## Data

Data was provided to me in form of csv and I converted it into json for ease of use in development process.

## Page Load Time

Since the application only renders static data, the initial overall page load time was 3 seconds (determined by analytic tool - Web.Dev). I further reduced the time to 2.4 seconds by using React.lazy() for code-splitting and asynchronous imports.
